![zoma](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66827498/116952742-0350a780-aca9-11eb-95cd-34ae03998ae0.jpg)

# Problem Statement

Zomato is one of the best online food delivery apps which gives the users the ratings and the reviews on restaurants all over india.These ratings and the Reviews are considered as one of the most important deciding factors which determine how good a restaurant is.

We will therefore use the real time Data set with variuos features a user would look into regarding a restaurant. We will be considering Banglore City in this analysis.


# The main agenda of this project is:

1. Perform extensive Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the Zomato Dataset.

2. Build an appropriate Machine Learning Model that will help various Zomato Restaurants to predict their respective Ratings based on certain features

3. DEPLOY the Machine learning model via Flask that can be used to make live predictions of restaurants ratings


# Topics covered:


 1. Creating a New Environment

  
 2. Loading required Libraries


 3. Loading the Dataset 


 4.Understanding the Data


6.Exploratory data analysis:


   1.Which restaurant has highest outlets in Bangaluru?

7. Feature Engineering:
 
       a) Handling Missing Values

       b) Encoding categorical data into numerical data


8. Feature Scailing


9. Feature Selection 


10. Feature importance 


11. Splitting dataset into train & test 


12. Applying ML models


13. Serialization(saving our model into pickle file)


14. Deployment using Flask Framework(we also have other servers like heroku,aws,azure,google cloud)
